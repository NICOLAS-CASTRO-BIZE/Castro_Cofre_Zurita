Below is a step-by-step tutorial that guides you through the process.\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\\n\\nFirst, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary packages:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install langchain langserve\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Create a Multi-Modal Chain\\n\\nMulti-modal models can process different types of data, such as text, images, and audio. In this example, we will create a simple chain that takes both text and image inputs.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain import Chain\\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain\\n\\n# Define your multi-modal model (for example, OpenAI\\'s CLIP model for images and text)\\ntext_model = OpenAI(model_name=\"text-davinci-003\")\\nimage_model = OpenAI(model_name=\"image-alpha-001\")  # Hypothetical model for images\\n\\n# Create a prompt template for text input\\ntext_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=\"Analyze the following text: {text}\")\\n\\n# Create a chain that processes text and image\\nclass MultiModalChain(Chain):\\n    def _call(self, inputs):\\n        text_input = inputs.get(\"text\")\\n        image_input = inputs.get(\"image\")\\n\\n        # Process text\\n        text_response = text_model(text_prompt.format(text=text_input))\\n\\n        # Process image (assuming image_input is a path or URL)\\n        image_response = image_model(image_input)\\n\\n        return {\\n            \"text_response\": text_response,\\n            \"image_response\": image_response\\n        }\\n\\n# Instantiate the multi-modal chain\\nmulti_modal_chain = MultiModalChain()\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Test Your Chain\\n\\nBefore deploying your chain as a REST API, it’s a good idea to test it locally.\\n\\n```python\\n# Test the chain with sample inputs\\ntest_inputs = {\\n    \"text\": \"What is the significance of the Eiffel Tower?\",\\n    \"image\": \"path/to/eiffel_tower_image.jpg\"  # Replace with actual image path or URL\\n}\\n\\noutput = multi_modal_chain(test_inputs)\\nprint(output)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Deploy the Chain as a REST API\\n\\nNow that you have a working multi-modal chain, you can deploy it as a REST API using LangServe.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langserve import LangServe\\n\\n# Create a LangServe app\\napp = LangServe()\\n\\n# Define an endpoint for your multi-modal chain\\n@app.route(\"/multi-modal\", methods=[\"POST\"])\\ndef multi_modal_endpoint():\\n    data = request.json\\n    response = multi_modal_chain(data)\\n    return jsonify(response)\\n\\n# Run the app\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    app.run(port=5000)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Test the REST API\\n\\nYou can test your REST API using tools like Postman or curl. Here’s an example using curl:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/multi-modal \\\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n-d \\'{\"text\": \"What is the significance of the Eiffel Tower?\", \"image\": \"path/to/eiffel_tower_image.jpg\"}\\'\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nYou have successfully created a multi-modal chain using LangChain and deployed it as a REST API using LangServe. You can now extend this setup by adding more complex logic, integrating additional models, or enhancing the API with more endpoints as needed. Happy coding!'}"
